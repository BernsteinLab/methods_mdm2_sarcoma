# Regulatory targets and impact of supraphysiologic MDM2 in sarcoma
Bioinformatics pipelines developed at the Bernstein lab for the analyses of RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq and hiChIP datasets in the article "Regulatory targets and impact of supraphysiologic MDM2 in sarcoma"

MDM2 amplification in tumor cells results in P53 inactivation. We investigated supraphysiologic MDM2 expression on chromatin states, gene expression and cellular phenotypes in liposarcoma tumors and models. Three independent gene regulatory circuits predominate in aggressive, dedifferentiated tumors. RUNX and AP-1 transcription factors bind mesenchymal gene enhancers that underlie the primitive developmental state. P53 and MDM2 co-occupy enhancers and promoters of P53 signaling genes. Unexpectedly, supraphysiologic MDM2 also binds thousands of P53-independent target genes involved in growth and stress responses that form multi-way topological interactions resembling transcriptional hubs. Imaging studies reveal MDM2 concentrates within nuclear foci colocalized with PML and YY1. We also observe striking cell-to-cell variability in MDM2 copy number and expression. Whereas liposarcoma cells are generally sensitive to MDM2 inhibitors and their combination with pro-apoptotic drugs in vitro, subpopulations with very high MDM2 are resistant to these targeted agents and may explain their poor clinical efficacy.
